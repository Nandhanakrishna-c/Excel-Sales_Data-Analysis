📊 Excel Dashboard: Sales Data Analysis

📝 Overview
This project presents an interactive Sales Analysis Dashboard built using Microsoft Excel. The goal is to analyze customer demographics and behavior patterns—such as vehicle and bike purchases—based on factors like gender, region, marital status, education level, and commute distance. This dashboard allows users to filter and explore key metrics and relationships within the dataset, making it a valuable tool for understanding sales performance and customer preferences.

🔍 Key Insights
1. Gender & Car Purchase: Males have a higher rate of car purchases compared to females, suggesting potential for gender-targeted marketing.

2. Gender & Bike Purchase: A larger number of male customers also purchase bikes, but the gap is less significant than for cars.

3. Region vs. Occupation & Total Income: Europe and North America show strong contributions to total income, especially from clerical and professional occupations.

4. Commute Distance Analysis: Most customers commute between 0–5 miles, and car purchases correlate positively with longer commute distances, indicating convenience as a key factor.

5. Marital Status, ID, and Age Analysis: Married individuals (especially middle-aged) are more likely to own vehicles, showing that life stage influences purchasing decisions.

6. Region & Bike Purchase: Europe and North America have higher numbers of bike purchases, whereas Pacific lags behind, potentially due to lifestyle or infrastructure differences.
